# \<bootstrap-grid\>

Use Bootstrap responsive 12 column grid styles in a Polymer component.

Inside this element you can use Bootstrap `col-*` classes as if you are in a `container-fluid`.

`--bootstrap-grid-gutter` sets gutters size, default 15px.

Currently the media breakpoints are hard coded, as `@media` queries can't apply CSS variables.
